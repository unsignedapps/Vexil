# Flag Keys

An in depth at how Vexil calculates the key for each of its flags, and how you can control that process.

## Overview

Lets be honest, any Feature Flag or Feature Toggle platform is just a glorified Key-Value store, and all Vexil does is map string-based keys into a strongly-typed hierarchy and provide a (hopefully) nice developer experience.

It's very important then when working with different ``FlagValueSource``s that you know how Vexil maps the ``FlagContainer``, ``FlagGroup`` and ``Flag``s into something that can work with any key-value store.

## FlagPole Configuration

You choose your encoding strategy and group separator when you initialise your ``FlagPole`` by passing in a ``VexilConfiguration`` instance:

```swift
let config = VexilConfiguration(codingPathStrategy: .snakecase, separator: "/")
let flagPole = FlagPole(hoist: MyFlags.self, configuration: config)
```

### Key encoding strategy

Vexil supports a number of different strategies to encoding keys. The default approach is the `kebabcase` encoding with period (`.`) separators.

You can find the key of a ``Flag`` at any time using its ``Flag/key`` property.

#### Kebab-case encoding

The default, the kebab-case encoding joins words in property names with dashes:

```swift
print(flagPole.subgroup.secondSubgroup.$myAwesomeFlag.key)

// outputs: "subgroup.second-subgroup.my-awesome-flag"
```

#### Snake-case encoding

Similarly, the snake-case encoding joins words in property names with underscores:

```swift
print(flagPole.subgroup.secondSubgroup.$myAwesomeFlag.key)

// outputs: "subgroup.second_subgroup.my_awesome_flag"
```

### Group separator

By default Vexil will join each level of the flag tree together with periods (`.`), but you can easily change that to anything else, like say slashes (`/`), so the kebab-case example above would become:

```swift
print(flagPole.subgroup.secondSubgroup.$myAwesomeFlag.key)

// outputs: "subgroup/second-subgroup/my-awesome-flag"
```

Which starts to look a lot like a file path.

### Prefixes

Vexil also supports an optional prefix for calculating its flag keys. So if you wanted to ensure that all feature flags in your `UserDefaults` started with a `feature.` for example, you could set the prefix to `"feature"`.

```swift
let config = VexilConfiguration(prefix: "feature")
let flagPole = FlagPole(hoist: MyFlags.self, configuration: config)

print(flagPole.subgroup.secondSubgroup.$myAwesomeFlag.key)

// outputs: "feature.subgroup.second-subgroup.my-awesome-flag"
```

## Flag Key Overrides

Sometimes though you want to override how a specific flag calculates its key. Vexil allows you to pass in a ``Flag/CodingKeyStrategy`` when you declare your ``Flag`` to alter how its key is calculated:

```swift
@Flag(codingKeyStrategy: .snakecase, description: "My Awesome Flag")
var myAwesomeFlag = false

// Key is "subgroup.second-subgroup.my_awesome_flag"
```

That would leave `myAwesomeFlag` calculating its key as `"subgroup.second-subgroup.my_awesome_flag"` while leaving the default behaviour of the ``FlagPole`` unchanged.

### Custom Key

You can also go for a manually specified key instead of a calculated one using a ``Flag/CodingKeyStrategy`` of `.customKey("my-key")`:

```swift
@Flag(codingKeyStrategy: .customKey("my-key"), description: "My Awesome Flag")
var myAwesomeFlag = false

// Key is "subgroup.second-subgroup.my-key"
```

### Custom Key Path

But sometimes your ``FlagValueSource`` doesn't play nice, or the people naming flags in the backend don't provide the same structure that you want your local flags to be in. You can instead set a manual key path. In this case the ``FlagPole`` will ignore the location of the ``Flag`` in the flag structure and will just use the key you specify.

```swift
@Flag(codingKeyStrategy: .customKeyPath("my-key"), description: "My Awesome Flag")
var myAwesomeFlag = false

// Key is "my-key"
```

## FlagGroup Overrides

While a ``FlagGroup`` doesn't have an explicit key of its own, it does form part of the calculated key. For example, if we declared our `MyFlags` structure as:

```swift
struct MyFlags: FlagContainer {
    
    @FlagGroup("A subgroup of flags")
    var subgroup: Subgroup
    
}
```

Then `"subgroup"` would form the first part of the key as calculated in the examples above.

Similarly to the ``Flag``s, we can customise the calculation of the ``FlagGroup``s key by passing in a custom ``FlagGroup/CodingKeyStrategy``.

``FlagGroup/CodingKeyStrategy`` supports most of the same basic options as the ``Flag`` above (eg, `.kebabcase`, `.snakecase`, and `.customKey(String)`), but it does not support a `.customKeyPath(String)`, because it does not have its own key calculated.

### Skipping FlagGroups

It does support an additional ``FlagGroup/CodingKeyStrategy`` though: `.skip`. Which will ignore that ``FlagGroup``s key in the calculation:

```swift
struct MyFlags: FlagContainer {
    
    @FlagGroup(codingKeyStrategy: .skip, description: "A second-level subgroup of flags")
    var secondSubgroup: SecondSubgroup
    
}

let flagPole = FlagPole(hoist: MyFlags.self)
print(flagPole.subgroup.secondSubgroup.$myAwesomeFlag.key)

// Outputs "subgroup.my-awesome-flag"
// (the "second-subgroup" component is omitted)
```
